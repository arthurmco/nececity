------

Nececity is a city emulator software written in Rust.

In it, you can create modern cities with your friends and family, and
over the internet. 

You will be able to build a city and focus it in a specific area:
being a massive energy producer, a technology point, a gambling
paradise or a summer dreamland!

The game will be also playable in servers within the Internet.

For more information, see the documentation in the docs/ folder
