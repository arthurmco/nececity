Gameplay
========

The primary difference is that, unlike other genres, you don't need to
have *everything* in your city, because, in real cities, you don't.

.. note::
   Like: you don't have a power plant, subway, an university etc., in
   one single city, why would you have in a virtual city?

So, instead of finding everything in a city, the citizens will search
in the entire "state".  
The citizen will have a job directly connected within a building
type. If this building is found within a certain distance, he'll not
move from your city. Otherwise, it will.

Also, you will be able to rent certain services from other cities,
like water treatment, energy and the like. As a consequence, those
services will be proportionally more expensive than other games of
same genre.

You will begin with some money and a terrain of a certain size. You
can earn money by making the value that you earn from taxation be
bigger than the cost of buildings
