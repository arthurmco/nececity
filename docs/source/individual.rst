Individual
==========

It all starts with the individual

The individual will have a profession, that is linked with a building
type. The said profession has a field and a instruction level. 

The individual will also have a sex and an age.

It also will have an intelligence level (affects how fast it
learns, and how much), a beauty level (affects how faster it
can find a partner), a speak level (affects how famous it can
be) and a health level (affect how hard it is for you to get a
disease). Those parameters will be created randomically on the first
generation, but will depend on the parents and grandparents for the
next ones.

It has, also, satisfaction levels for knowledge, health, neighborhood,
safety, air quality and entertainment.

When the individual reach a certain age, it can leave its home, only
for marriage and universities (or any other high instructional level
education places). On some holidays they will visit his family, then
her family, then his family... until the parents die.

People die within 50-110 years of live, depending on the wealth,
intelligence and health levels.
