Dating and marriage
===================

When someone is more than 16 years old, is time to start
dating. In the game, people usually date with school colleagues,
neighborhood colleagues or job colleagues. 

A person will choose other person that has the same job interest,
intelligence, appearance, speak ability, wealth or lives in the same
region as him.  
For now, one person will choose other person of the opposite sex (like I
said before, I might introduce gay couples, for realism), give a weight
for each attribute, and choose the one that has the highest
score. If the other person holds the pretendent as one of the 3
highest scored persons, they start dating.

When finding pretendents, people who are dating have a score
reduction, that increases on engagement, and on marriage.

The relationship finishes when the score reduces too much, or when a
better person appears in the same school, neighborhood or job.

If the relationship lasts more than 5 years, it's time to
engage. Here, both scores double.  
If the relationship lasts more 1-2 years, depending on wealth (we have
to prepare the marriage), it's time to marry. The scores double again
here.

If a couple break, they resume finding a partner after 1 month ~~of sorrow~~.

People usually have children within 1-5 year of marriage, depending on
wealth. The number of children depends on the intelligence and beauty
level of the couple: intelligence decrease the quantity, beauty
increase.
