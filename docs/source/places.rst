Places
======

The places are, well, places where individuals meet. The standards
(like wealth, safety, intelligence) of every people will update when
they go to the main places (the workplace, for adults, or the school,
for not adults). 

The people will usually be friends of other people with the same
wealth. 

> For parents, it is *their* wealth that counts, not the family
> ones. For children, otherwise, is the *family* wealth.

If the wealth distribution is too uneven, even their friends will be
significantly richer than them. The individual will become sad, and
unproductive, and will eventually be fired.

It will need to find other places, Every place that fits it is OK,
but the last two it worked. If it can't find a fitting place, the
individual will be unemployed.

To overcome the sadness for being too poor -- or too rich! It *can*
happen on the other side too --, build more houses and appropriate
jobs.

.. info::
   Yes, even in the real world there are jobs that people see as
   "poor people jobs", and ones that people see as "rich people jobs".

Usually, workplaces and schools are places where individuals meet,
but, in entertainment places, families meet, and the family attributes
are compared.
