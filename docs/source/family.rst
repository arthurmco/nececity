Family
======

Then, we have a family. A family, in the game, has a man, a woman and
zero or more kids, of random genders.

.. note::
   In the game, mostly low-instruction people, with some exceptions,
   will migrate to your city at first.

.. note::
   I might include gay couples in the game, because we're all for
   diversity today :wink: And because they *do* exist IRL
   

Each kid will have a predisposition to a profession, that will last
until it completes 18, the time where it becomes the kid -- now, a
teen -- profession.

This predisposed profession will depend on the family wealth. If the
family is wealthy, the kid will mostly choose the profession of one of
its parents

.. note::
   The wealth is proportional: it will depend on the average of the
   kid's school colleagues: if its family wealth is bigger than a
   certain percentage above the average, his family is wealthy, if is
   below than a certain percentage, his family is poor, and if is in
   the middle, his family is on the average.

If the family is poor, the kid will choose other alternative
profession.

The family will also have an instruction level. The family instruction
level is the weightened average of it's members. Both parents have a
bigger weight than the children.

The kid increase of instruction level depends on how good the
school is, and how much smart the kid is (see "Individual")

The smart children will also need more specialized schools, like
technical ones, to improve their knowledge. If the city and the
neighbor cities lack this type of city, the kid knowledge satisfaction
will decrease.

The satisfaction levels that can affect something are the levels of
each family: the average value of satisfaction of each member
